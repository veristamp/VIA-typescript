## Core Engineering Principles

1. Always create tests according to real-world use cases, not only the happy path of the code.
2. Our goal is minimal code with maximum impact. Large code is not always necessary; smart architecture decisions should reduce unnecessary code and complexity.
3. Focus on stability, accuracy, and useful features. Never take bypasses just to pass tests or force outcomes. Always consider the broader spectrum and solve issues holistically.
